# Welcome

## Bienvenida

¡Hola! Este repositorio es un compendio de proyectos creativos, reflexiones y
ejercicios. Encontrarás desde relatos breves hasta pequeños experimentos con
código. Explora las carpetas y descubre ideas que quizás te inspiren a
construir algo nuevo.

This repository aims to compile most of my entries or posts. The idea is that it serves as a starting point for creating web pages, sharing ideas, or collaboratively editing code.

### Project Purpose

This project was created for the purposes of dissemination, learning, and innovation. I firmly believe that sharing knowledge is a powerful way to express ideas and foster creativity. This space seeks to be independent, functional, and enriching.

### My Personal Log

- This repository is my personal log, a place where I capture thoughts, learnings, and projects.
- Most of my repositories are currently in **Spanish** as part of my learning journey, but I plan to progressively create content in **English** as well.
- This GitHub repository is created to store and manage my drafts before publishing them on my blogs, as well as to include some innovative proposals developed as tasks to organize my ideas and control various entries.
